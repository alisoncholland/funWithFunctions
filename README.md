A collection of commonly used graphs for survey analysis including functions. 
This code will do the following:
1. Created many different types of graphs including dodge, stacked, Likert and radar / spider graphs
2. Calculate the confidence intervals (CIs) as a first check for significant differences
I used the free statistical software programme R (https://www.r-project.org/) to write and analyse my data. Once R is up and running, download the CRAN packages MAc (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MAc/index.html), metafor (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metafor/index.html), and dplyr https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html.
Usage
Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
